running applications
--------------------------
To run the python applications in TensorFlow, please execute the following commands for each application:
> bash bigmatrixmultiplication.sh
> bash synchronoussgd.sh
> bash launch_asyncsgd.sh
> bash batchsynchronoussgd.sh
> bash launch_batchasyncsgd.sh

* Arguments are already hard coded in the <application>.py files, please feel free to change them if you need.
* At the beginning of each script, `tfdef.sh` will be sourced, and the unclosed cluster jobs will be closed, this
  is just for sanity check to make sure the script will be run correctly.
* For `launch_asyncsgd.sh` and `launch_batchasyncsgd.sh`, the output will be redirected into local files and all
  those output file will be copied back to master side.
  for asyncsgd, the output files' name are in format of async-<task_index>.out
  for batchasyncsgd, the output files' name are in format of batchasync-<task_index>.out
  in which <task_index> is in range of {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}
